# Mini Chess Game Project
This project is a simple implementation of a mini chess game using Python and Pygame.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

## Running the Game
To run the game, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```
python main.py
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the game loop and handles events.
- `chessboard.py`: Contains the ChessBoard class for rendering the chessboard.

## Documentation

For more information about Pygame and its functions, refer to the official Pygame documentation:

## Next Steps

This project currently only renders the chessboard. Future improvements could include:
- Adding chess pieces
- Implementing game logic
- Creating a user interface for moves

Feel free to contribute to this project and expand its functionality!
